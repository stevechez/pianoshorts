          Memories With Dad

          So Gordon Lightfoot came on the radio and it struck a cord, so I
          decided to write a few memories of dad from back in the day, and share
          with some piano accompaniment.

          I remember the church trip with John Duruntz with his 12 string guitar
          and watchful audience. As he began to play to the group, who can
          forget Dad&apos; does a huge nose blow. A pauses and he begins again,
          only to stopped by loud wood chopping.

          And who can forget the BMW and infamous tape deck. I swear he only
          owned one tape in that car, Christopher Cross. I remember riding in
          the car jamming to &quote;Ride Like The Wind&quote; every time.

          And what about Pinecrest, when those kids up on the cliff were
          throwing rocks into the lake. The rock hit his artery could have hit
          Mark in the head. I don&apos;t remember what happened after the boat
          ride, but at the memories of the time is clear.

          Then was great America. Dad doesn&apos;t seem to remember it, but it
          happened, riding the Tidal Wave, the Demon, and winning the giant
          stuffed tiger we proudly carried out of the park. Father/son bonding
          at its best.

          Great memories of skiing Tahoe Ski Bowl as a kid. One memory in
          particular, me and Dad were skiing together and thought we&apos;d
          attack the Face. I started down ahead of him, took an almost crash
          head over heels. I think I broke my ski, was down for a minute Dad,
          standing up, looking at me, he skis down. I pull myself up and rally
          &quot;Stefanos on the move again&quot;.

          I remember, one time at college everyone was leaving out for a spring
          break or Thanksgiving break, and I couldn&apos;t find a ride home. I
          didn&apos;t have a car, and I really wanted to go home. Dad jumped in
          the car drove four hours one-way, picked me up, and drove four hours
          back. I was thankful for that.
        </p>

          The fishing trip was one of my favorites. Actually, no one really
          caught any fish, as I recall, but with dad, we caught the biggest
          lunker that I&apos;ll never forget. Not to mention, we were two of
          almost every person on the boat that did not get sick.
